# Semiautomatic-Emergency-Check-List
‚ùó
*I'm not a computer scientist or java programmer. 
I studied what I needed to create this project, and it works. 
Over time I'll optimise the code.*

Designed to help with emergency management.  
The file includes a check list of things to do and an events log so the operators can use this single file to track everything.  
When the emergency is over, the operator clicks the reset button. A copy of the file is created (so there is a history) and the whole file is cleaned of what the operator has written.  
The file is once again ready to be used in the next emergency.
